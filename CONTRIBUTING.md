# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to PuppyOne!

## Developer Setup

- Fork and clone the repo
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in `backend/` and `frontend/` and fill in your credentials
- See [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for full setup instructions

## Code Style

- **Frontend**: TypeScript/React — follow existing formatting; run `npm run lint` in `frontend/`
- **Backend**: Python 3.12+, use `ruff` formatting (configured in `pyproject.toml`); run `uv run ruff format`

## Configuration Files

- **Single source of truth**: Use `pyproject.toml` for all Python tool configurations (pytest, ruff, mypy, etc.)
- **Do NOT create** `pytest.ini`, `setup.cfg`, or other tool-specific config files
- **Rationale**: Prevents configuration drift (PEP 518 standard)

## Branches and Environments

We use a three-branch promotion model:

| Branch   | Environment | Who pushes here          | How code arrives                         |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `main`   | production  | nobody directly          | merge from `qubits` or same-repo `hotfix/*` |
| `qubits` | staging     | nobody directly          | merge from `newmu` or external forks     |
| `newmu`  | dev         | core team (PRs welcome)  | direct push or PR from feature branch    |

`main` and `qubits` are protected: no direct pushes (not even by admins). Every
change reaches them through a Pull Request that satisfies branch protection
rules (PR + required reviews + required status checks).

## Branch Naming

- `feature/<short-slug>` or `feat/<short-slug>`
- `fix/<short-slug>`
- `perf/<short-slug>`
- `docs/<short-slug>`
- `chore/<short-slug>`
- `hotfix/<short-slug>` (urgent fix targeting production)
- `temp/<short-slug>` (may be auto-cleaned once merged and idle >14 days)
- `revert-<sha-or-slug>`

## Pull Request Flow

### External contributors (from a fork)

1. Fork the repo on GitHub.
2. Create a feature branch **from `qubits`** (not `main`):
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/puppyone-ai/puppyone.git
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout -b feat/my-change upstream/qubits
   ```
3. Commit, push to your fork, then open a Pull Request:
   - **Base repository**: `puppyone-ai/puppyone`
   - **Base branch**: `qubits` (not `main` — `main` is reserved for releases and hotfixes)
   - **Compare**: `your-fork:feat/my-change`
4. CI does not run automatically on first-time external PRs. A maintainer will
   click "Approve and run workflows" after a quick safety review.
5. After review and CI passes, a maintainer merges into `qubits`. The change
   reaches production when the next `qubits` → `main` release PR is merged.

### Internal contributors (core team)

1. **Default (features, refactors, non-urgent fixes)**: branch from `newmu`,
   open PR into `qubits`. After validation in staging, open the next release
   PR `qubits` → `main`.
2. **Release to production**: open PR `qubits` → `main`.
3. **Hotfix (production-only urgent fix)**: create a same-repo branch from
   `main` named `hotfix/<short-slug>`, then open PR `hotfix/<short-slug>` →
   `main`. After release, immediately back-merge `main` → `qubits` → `newmu`
   to keep all branches in sync.

`main` PRs are guarded by **Main Release Gate**:

- `qubits` → `main` is allowed as the normal release path.
- same-repo `hotfix/*` → `main` is allowed for urgent production fixes.
- all other sources targeting `main` are blocked.
- if the PR author is not `realGuantum`, `realGuantum` must approve the PR.

> Why back-merge after every hotfix: `main`, `qubits`, and `newmu` are
> long-lived branches. A production-only fix must be propagated back into the
> staging and dev branches immediately, otherwise the next regular
> `qubits` → `main` release may re-open the same file conflicts.

## CI Checks

| Check                | Trigger                                  | Required for merge                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Frontend Build**   | PRs that touch `frontend/**`             | `main`, `qubits`                    |
| **Run Gitleaks**     | All PRs, push to `main`, weekly schedule | `main`, `qubits`                    |
| **Main Release Gate** | PRs targeting `main`                    | `main` (release/hotfix source + owner gate) |
| **E2E Visual Tests** | Manual (`workflow_dispatch`)            | (manual release/debug check)        |
| **Supabase Preview** | All PRs                                  | (advisory, not blocking)            |
| **Branch housekeeping** | Weekly schedule                       | n/a (cleanup job)                   |

Branch housekeeping may delete merged remote branches idle >14 days. Protected
branches (`main`, `qubits`, `newmu`) are never deleted.

## Testing

Test layers:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `unit` | Pure functions/classes, no external deps |
| `integration` | In-process integration (Supabase/Redis) |
| `contract` | FastAPI route contract tests |
| `e2e` | Full stack with Docker Compose |

Local commands (from `backend/`):

```bash
uv run pytest -v -m "unit"
uv run pytest -v -m "integration"
uv run pytest -v -m "not e2e"
```

## Commit & PR Guidelines

- Use concise commit messages with conventional prefixes: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `perf`, `docs`
- **Default PR target is `qubits`** (staging). Only release PRs (`qubits` → `main`) and same-repo production hotfix PRs (`hotfix/*` → `main`) should target `main`.
- Include a clear description and test plan in PRs (the PR template will prompt you).
- Link related issues with `Fixes #123` or `Refs #123`.
- Do not include unrelated changes in the same PR — keep PRs focused so review and rollback stay easy.

## Security

- Never commit real secrets or `.env` files
- If a secret leaks, rotate immediately and follow the cleanup steps in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
