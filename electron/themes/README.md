# PuppyOne Sub Themes

This folder is the runtime guide copied into the user Themes Folder. A Sub Theme changes the visual variant of a compatible PuppyOne Root Theme; it does not replace the application shell or style editor internals.

## Appearance model

PuppyOne resolves appearance in four layers:

1. **Root Theme** owns shell structure, component geometry, interaction policy, and the public token contract. Current Root Themes are `default` and `windows-xp`.
2. **Color Mode** resolves `light` or `dark` inside the active Root Theme. `system` is a request that resolves to one of those effective modes.
3. **Sub Theme** supplies a compatible visual variant for the effective mode. Light and Dark selections are remembered independently inside each Root Theme.
4. **Surface overrides** are typed product settings, such as Markdown heading scale. They have final authority and are not arbitrary CSS.

The user-facing resolution is:

`Root Theme → effective Color Mode → compatible Sub Theme variant → typed surface overrides → accessibility/last-resort product overrides`

Underneath that model, a generated Neutral fallback sits at the lowest CSS
layer. It keeps the client readable when a theme is missing or damaged; it is
not another selectable theme and never outranks a valid Root/Sub Theme.

Shared editors remain generic. They inherit public `--po-host-md-*` and `--po-host-csv-*` tokens from the application root; installed themes cannot select CodeMirror, Markdown, CSV, or other editor implementation nodes.

## Where this folder belongs

Open **Settings → Appearance → Open Themes Folder**. Add either:

- a directory containing one self-describing `theme.css` file (recommended);
- a directory containing `theme.json` and one CSS entrypoint per declared target; or
- one top-level `.css` file using the coordinated `@puppyone-theme` format below.

PuppyOne refreshes the catalog when its window regains focus.

The **+** action in Appearance creates a new `custom-theme/theme.css`, reveals
the file in this folder, refreshes the catalog, and selects it. Repeated use
creates `custom-theme-2`, `custom-theme-3`, and so on. The built-in Sub Themes
remain inside the application and are intentionally not copied here as editable
duplicates.

The recommended user layout is:

```text
themes/
├── ocean/
│   └── theme.css
└── newsprint/
    └── theme.css
```

The directory name is organizational for installed themes. Identity always
comes from the `id` inside `@puppyone-theme`.

## Package format

`theme.json`:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "com.example.newsprint",
  "name": "Newsprint",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Example Studio",
  "compatibleRootThemeIds": ["default"],
  "modes": ["light", "dark"],
  "targets": ["application", "markdown", "csv"],
  "entrypoints": {
    "application": "application.css",
    "markdown": "markdown.css",
    "csv": "csv.css"
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `id` is a stable lowercase reverse-domain identifier with at least three segments.
- `compatibleRootThemeIds` defaults to `["default"]` when omitted.
- `modes` contains one or both of `light` and `dark`.
- A theme appears only when it declares a variant for the current effective mode. A light-only theme is never offered while Dark is active.
- Light and Dark are independent user slots. Selecting a theme for Light does not overwrite the remembered Dark theme, and vice versa.
- `targets` contains one or more of `application`, `markdown`, and `csv` and must match `entrypoints` exactly.
- Each entrypoint is a direct package-local `.css` filename.

## Single-file format

```css
@puppyone-theme {
  id: com.example.newsprint;
  name: Newsprint;
  version: 1.0.0;
  author: Example Studio;
  compatible-root-themes: default;
  modes: light dark;
}

@puppyone application {
  :root {
    --po-surface-canvas: #f5f0e8;
    /* An opaque literal enables matching browser and native first paint. */
    --po-canvas: #f5f0e8;
    --po-text: #2f2b27;
    --po-accent: #8b2f24;
  }

  .dark .theme-root {
    --po-surface-canvas: #17130f;
    --po-canvas: #17130f;
    --po-text: #f4eee6;
    --po-accent: #d99082;
  }
}

@puppyone markdown {
  :root {
    --po-md-surface-background: #f5f0e8;
    --po-md-content-color: #342f29;
    --po-md-content-font: Georgia, serif;
    --po-md-link-color: #8b2f24;
  }
}

@puppyone csv {
  :root {
    --po-csv-surface-background: #f5f0e8;
    --po-csv-surface-color: #342f29;
    --po-editable-table-border: #cbbfaf;
  }
}
```

A metadata-free top-level CSS file is accepted as a Markdown-only compatibility theme only when it follows the same root-token contract.

`modes` is a capability contract, not descriptive text. Internally PuppyOne
normalizes it into explicit `variants.light` / `variants.dark` records and
injects only the effective variant. Common root declarations may be shared by
both modes, while `.dark` declarations provide Dark overrides. A light-only
theme may not contain hidden `.dark` selectors, and themes may not use
`prefers-color-scheme` to bypass the selected Color Mode.

For an Application target, declare `--po-canvas` as an opaque three- or
six-digit hex literal in every supported mode. PuppyOne compiles this token
into the synchronous browser and native-window first-paint value. Other CSS
forms remain valid as runtime tokens, but cannot be safely evaluated before
CSS loads; a missing or invalid first-paint literal therefore uses the Neutral
fallback until the selected theme mounts. Built-in Application themes are
stricter and fail generation when a declared mode omits this literal.

## Built-in source packages

Checked-in Sub Themes use the same single-file parser and token compiler as
installed themes. Their repository source is intentionally data-only:

```text
sub-themes/
├── default-neutral/theme.css
├── default-warm/theme.css
├── default-graphite/theme.css
├── default-github/theme.css
├── default-newspaper/theme.css
└── windows-xp-luna-blue/theme.css
```

There is no hand-written `manifest.ts` and no hand-maintained built-in registry.
Each package contains exactly one `theme.css`. Run `npm run generate:sub-themes`
after editing or adding a package; the generator parses metadata, validates Root
Theme compatibility and targets, compiles public tokens, and writes the runtime
registry plus generated fallback/first-paint projections. `default-neutral`
is both a normal theme and the sole editable fallback source.
`npm run check:sub-themes` rejects stale output or an invalid package.

Reserved two-segment IDs, `builtin-order`, and `legacy-*-preset` metadata are
accepted only by this checked-in generator. Installed themes continue to use
reverse-domain IDs and cannot opt into product compatibility metadata.

## CSS boundary

Every rule must be root-only. Use `:root`, `.theme-root`, `html`, `body`, or `#write` as an authoring alias; PuppyOne compiles the alias to its scoped appearance root. Dark values may use `.theme-root.dark` or `.dark .theme-root`.

Allowed examples:

```css
:root {
  --po-md-content-color: #342f29;
  --po-md-h1-size: 2em;
}

.dark .theme-root {
  --po-md-content-color: #ece8e1;
}
```

Disallowed examples:

```css
/* Element and implementation selectors are rejected. */
h1 { color: red; }
.theme-root h1 { color: red; }
.cm-editor { background: red; }
.markdown-codemirror-editor { color: red; }

/* Global resources and forced precedence are rejected. */
@font-face { font-family: Reader; src: url("reader.woff2"); }
:root { --po-md-content-color: red !important; }
```

The compiler also rejects remote imports, external URLs, global selectors, sibling escapes, unsupported at-rules, normal CSS declarations, and unknown tokens. `@import` may reference only package-local CSS and imported files must follow the same contract.

## Public tokens

Application targets accept only the published PuppyOne color tokens, including:

- surfaces: `--po-surface-canvas`, `--po-surface-chrome`, `--po-surface-panel`, `--po-control`;
- text and borders: `--po-text`, `--po-text-muted`, `--po-border`, `--po-divider`;
- state: `--po-hover`, `--po-selected`, `--po-accent`, `--po-focus-ring`, `--po-danger`, `--po-success`, `--po-warning`.

Markdown targets accept the public `--po-md-*` presentation tokens, such as content, heading, link, quote, inline-code, code-block, and syntax colors. CSV targets accept `--po-csv-*` plus the documented `--po-editable-table-*` presentation tokens.

PuppyOne maps these author-facing names to private host-boundary variables during compilation. Do not author `--po-host-*` variables directly.

## Troubleshooting

- If a theme is absent, inspect the diagnostics shown in Appearance settings.
- If a theme falls back, confirm that `compatibleRootThemeIds`, `modes`, and `targets` satisfy the active Root Theme.
- The `default` Root Theme requires `application`, `markdown`, and `csv`; `windows-xp` currently requires `markdown` and `csv` and supports light mode only.
- If a visual value seems overridden, check typed surface preferences. Those intentionally have higher priority than a Sub Theme.
