## B00merang Windows-XP icon theme

The Windows XP interface Style includes seven 128px toolbar assets and ten
hand-tuned 16px Explorer folder/file assets from the
`B00merang-Artwork/Windows-XP` icon theme at immutable commit
`24e95ad2b12c55dd11883ee7066525527d944039`: `gtk-directory.png`,
`dotNETconnectedtechnology.png`, `gnome-system.png`, `emblem-system.png`,
`gnome-remote-desktop.png`, `utilities-terminal.png`, and `gnobots2.png`.
The Explorer assets are the 16px `places/gtk-directory.png`,
`status/stock_open.png`, and the `mimetypes` assets `gtk-file.png`, `html.png`,
`gnome-mime-image.png`, `gnome-mime-audio.png`, `video-x-generic.png`,
`application-pdf.png`, `zip.png`, and `application-x-executable.png`; their
original PNG payloads are embedded without pixel modification in
text-reviewable SVG containers. The assets are
redistributed under the GNU General Public License, version 2. The complete
license text is distributed at
`src/styles/interfaces/windows-xp/assets/B00MERANG-WINDOWS-XP-GPL-2.0.txt`.

## B00merang Windows-XP Luna caption buttons

The Windows XP interface Style includes the normal, hover, and pressed 21x21
minimize, maximize, and close caption-button assets from
`B00merang-Project/Windows-XP` at immutable commit
`7637830906823af40a3cd7e7079be753d8b7d679`. The source files are the
`Windows XP Luna/metacity-1/minimize*.png`, `maximize*.png`, and `close*.png`
state images. Their original PNG payloads are embedded without pixel
modification in text-reviewable SVG containers and are restricted to the
Windows XP Style Pack.

The assets are redistributed under the GNU General Public License, version 3.
The complete license text is distributed at
`src/styles/interfaces/windows-xp/assets/B00MERANG-WINDOWS-XP-THEME-GPL-3.0.txt`.

## Git official logomark

The Windows XP interface Style includes the official orange Git logomark by
Jason Long. The SVG is redistributed without modification; PuppyOne applies
only a CSS drop shadow when it is painted in the toolbar. The mark is licensed
under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

## GNOME gitg classic icon

The Windows XP interface Style uses the 256px `gitg` application icon from
the official GNOME gitg v0.3.3 tag. The unmodified PNG is redistributed under
the GNU General Public License, version 2. The complete license text is at
`src/styles/interfaces/windows-xp/assets/GITG-GPL-2.0.txt`.

## Crystal Clear configure icon

The Windows XP interface Style uses the 128px `Action configure` icon from
Everaldo Coelho's Crystal Clear icon set for Settings. The asset is
redistributed without modification under the GNU Lesser General Public
License, version 2.1 or later. The complete LGPL 2.1 text is distributed at
`src/styles/interfaces/windows-xp/assets/CRYSTAL-CLEAR-LGPL-2.1.txt`.

## Third-party product marks

Agent, Terminal, and Cloud integration surfaces include local marks solely to
identify user-selected third-party products. These include Codex, ChatGPT,
Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Hermes, Manus, Pi, Gmail, Google Calendar,
Google Docs, Google Sheets, Airtable, Notion, Linear, Supabase, Slack, and Git.
All product names and marks belong to their respective owners. Their appearance
does not imply sponsorship or endorsement.

The Codex mark is a size-optimized copy of the official Codex application icon;
the Claude mark follows Anthropic's published product identity, the Cursor mark
follows Cursor's official application/brand asset, and the OpenCode mark comes
from `packages/identity/mark.svg` in the official OpenCode repository. PuppyOne
ships bounded local copies so opening a menu never performs a remote image
request.

## OpenCode

PuppyOne Desktop can distribute and run the OpenCode coding-agent harness as
the managed kernel behind PuppyOne Agent. The adopted runtime release is
`v1.17.18` at commit
`b8374b5a7c532e51aeb66b1dee9278de91526ef5`; its prompt hashes are taken from
that exact commit. Broader architecture behavior was also audited at later
source commit `9976269ab1accfc9f9dc98a4a688c516934de422`.
The main process communicates with the runtime through Agent Client Protocol
v1 over NDJSON JSON-RPC 2.0. The retired HTTP SDK client is not shipped.

OpenCode is Copyright (c) 2025 opencode and licensed under the MIT License.
The complete license text is distributed at `vendor/opencode/LICENSE` and in
the packaged `resources/opencode/LICENSE` file.

The exact artifact hashes, prompt-source hashes, and source-adoption ledger are
distributed in `vendor/opencode/`.

## Claude Agent SDK

PuppyOne Desktop uses the exact-version
`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk@0.3.159` as the control layer for the native
Claude Code backend. PuppyOne does not redistribute the SDK's optional
platform executable; the backend uses the user's canonical Claude Code
installation. The SDK is © Anthropic PBC, all rights reserved, and its use is
subject to Anthropic's applicable legal agreements. The package license notice is retained at
`vendor/claude-agent-sdk/LICENSE.md`; current terms are linked from
https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance.

Anthropic's published authentication policy does not permit third-party
products to route traffic through users' Free, Pro or Max Claude subscription
credentials. PuppyOne therefore requires an Anthropic API key or a supported
cloud-provider credential for this backend and does not copy Claude credential
files. Claude Agent SDK usage may be subject to Anthropic's documented data
collection, usage and retention policies.

## Claudian frontend reference

PuppyOne Desktop selectively adapts interaction, presentation and native
protocol orchestration patterns from `YishenTu/claudian` at immutable commit
`7d7cc84c60a77431aaccda7ff49a2f1f4ae1c2ab`. The adopted runtime patterns are
the persistent Claude SDK message channel, Electron-safe CLI spawning, and ACP
method compatibility/event normalization. PuppyOne rewrites these patterns
under its own typed `AgentRuntimePort`, canonical workspace boundary, approval
policy, React design tokens, accessibility behavior and virtualization.
Claudian credential stores, prompts, conversation persistence and Obsidian
integration are not included.

Claudian is licensed under the MIT License. The complete license, source map and
CycloneDX record are distributed in `vendor/claudian/LICENSE`,
`vendor/claudian/SOURCE_ADOPTION.md` and `vendor/claudian/SBOM.cdx.json`.
