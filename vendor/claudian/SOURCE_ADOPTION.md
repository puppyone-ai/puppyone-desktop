# Claudian source-adoption ledger

Pinned source audit: `YishenTu/claudian@7d7cc84c60a77431aaccda7ff49a2f1f4ae1c2ab`.

PuppyOne adopts selected frontend interaction patterns and native
protocol-orchestration patterns. The implementation is rewritten against
PuppyOne's normalized Agent contract, canonical workspace authorization,
process lifecycle, design tokens, virtualized timeline and accessibility
rules. No Claudian prompt, credential store, conversation database, Obsidian
API integration or brand asset is included.

| PuppyOne implementation | Audited upstream reference | Adoption and modification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/features/desktop-agent/ui/AgentPartRenderer.tsx` and `ui/activity/**` | `src/features/chat/rendering/MessageRenderer.ts`, `ToolCallRenderer.ts`, `WriteEditRenderer.ts`, `collapsible.ts` | Stable React renderer registry and accessible disclosure rewrite. Adopts compact tool rows, branch-style expanded content and bounded inline diff presentation. Adds strict normalized DTOs, keyboard semantics and virtual-list-safe lifecycle. |
| `src/features/desktop-agent/ui/AgentPickerPopover.tsx`, `AgentProviderPicker.tsx`, `AgentModelPicker.tsx` | `src/style/toolbar/model-selector.css`, chat model selector behavior | React listbox rewrite with click, Escape, outside click, arrows, Home/End, typeahead/search, focus return and inspectable disabled rows. The session-level Agent selector lives in the sub-header; backend-scoped Model controls remain in the composer. |
| `src/features/desktop-agent/ui/AgentComposer.tsx` | `src/style/components/input.css` | Adopts the compact bordered composer hierarchy; preserves PuppyOne attachment, context, mode, Model, Send/Stop and security boundaries without duplicating the session-level Agent selector. |
| `src/features/desktop-agent/ui/desktop-agent.css` and `ui/styles/*.css` | `src/style/base/{variables,animations,container}.css`, `src/style/components/{messages,input,toolcalls,code,thinking}.css`, `src/style/features/diff.css`, `src/style/toolbar/model-selector.css` | Tokenized, responsibility-split rewrite using PuppyOne semantic colors, spacing and responsive container queries. Picker styling is isolated from composer styling; the session sub-header reuses PuppyOne's sidebar geometry. |
| `electron/main/agent/protocols/acp/**` | `src/providers/acp/AcpClientConnection.ts`, `AcpJsonRpcTransport.ts`, `AcpSessionUpdateNormalizer.ts`, `methodNames.ts` | Provider-neutral JavaScript rewrite of ACP method fallback, long-running prompt semantics and normalized session updates. Adds strict JSON-RPC framing limits, redaction and a fail-closed server-request allowlist. |
| `electron/main/agent/runtimes/opencode-protocol/opencode-acp-adapter.mjs` | `src/providers/opencode/runtime/OpencodeChatRuntime.ts` | Session-scoped ACP lifecycle adaptation. PuppyOne removes Claudian conversation ownership, prompt settings and Obsidian state; OpenCode remains the harness while PuppyOne owns routing, approvals and the live event projection. |
| `electron/main/agent/runtimes/claude/claude-message-channel.mjs` and `claude-spawn.mjs` | `src/providers/claude/runtime/ClaudeMessageChannel.ts`, `customSpawn.ts`, `ClaudeQueryOptionsBuilder.ts` | Bounded persistent-query channel and Electron-safe spawn adaptation. PuppyOne disables prompt queuing, forbids permission bypass, limits settings to the user source, redacts diagnostics and rejects unsupported secure CLI capabilities. |
| `electron/main/agent/runtimes/{codex,claude}/**`, `protocols/acp/acp-event-normalizer.mjs`, `domain/agent-activity-presentation.ts` | `src/core/tools/toolNames.ts`, `src/providers/{codex,opencode}/normalization/*ToolNormalization.ts`, `ToolCallRenderer.ts` | Provider-specific rewrite that preserves native Read/Write/Edit/Grep/Glob/Bash identity and structured input. Adds transparent, conservative `via Bash` semantics for recognized read-only Codex command executions without changing their approval or execution class. |

Claudian's imperative DOM renderer and hover-only model menu were not copied.
PuppyOne keeps React ownership, a maximum of 120 mounted transcript rows,
explicit reduced-motion behavior and the multi-native backend boundary in
[`ADR-005`](../../docs/architecture/desktop-agent/ADR-005-multi-native-agent-backends.md).
Each supported native harness still owns its own loop, tool calling and native
sessions. PuppyOne does not import Claudian as a runtime dependency and does
not rename a Claudian harness as a PuppyOne harness.
